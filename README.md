# What the duck?! - Milestone project 2 - HTML, CSS & Javascript

What the duck?! is a user-friendly memory card game designed for duck enthusiasts and casual gamers alike. Thanks to the website's full responsiveness, the game can be played on all devices. Clear instructions are provided, making it easy for users to understand how the game works and start playing right away. The game also features high-quality, vibrant and fun images of ducks, adding to the entertainment.
