# What the duck?! - Milestone project 2 - HTML, CSS & Javascript

What the duck?! is a user-friendly memory card game designed for duck enthusiasts and casual gamers alike. Thanks to the website's full responsiveness, the game can be played on all devices. Clear instructions are provided, making it easy for users to understand how the game works and start playing right away. The game also features high-quality, vibrant and fun images of ducks, adding to the entertainment.

## Design

The overall feel of the website and game is supposed to be fun, vibrant and playful. To accomplish this, the typhography, colors and imagery are all picked based on those words.

### Typography

**h1-elements**

I chose the Google font _Slackey_ since it has a playful look but is still readable. It's used for the logotype and button texts.

**h2-elements, h3-elements**

All subheadings use the Google font _Original surfer_ because it's playful yet readable.

**p-elements**

Text elements on the website use the Google Font _Sour Gummy_. It has a playful tone while maintaining a higher level of readability, which is essential for text blocks.
